3. Check what kinds of promotion materials that you need to provide by checking the #**Sponsors_Materials_Example**# folder above. We prepared some examples for you and please make sure you are using the same size of those examples. We advise you to open our example with your Photoshop(or other image editor) and delete our example, then put your own materials in.

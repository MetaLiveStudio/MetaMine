We advise you to open our example with your Photoshop(or other image editor), and then delete our example and then put your own materials in.

* Attention: Most of the examples are very straightforward, just be careful with your rewards related pictures, **please name them following this principle Name_(amount)** we will use the pictures and the amount information to create raffle ticket for you (if you don't have a newly published Decentraland wearable)

1. After you’ve chosen the tier, you can send us the payment in USDC/USDT to the following address(ETH or Polygon). Address: 0x05060Fa97e54a812d1E15cEc6c34e79f74eBD0b3

2. Send your rewards (Token or NFTs) to the following address(ETH or Polygon): 0x1274e61cd2Fd3368B3886Dc5C79f1FA98832Ef31

* Please contact us if your rewards are on other chains or they are physical products.

3. Check what kinds of promotion materials that you need to provide by checking the #**Sponsors_Materials_Example**# folder above. We prepared some examples for you and please make sure you are using the same size of those examples. We advise you to open our example with your Photoshop(or other image editor) and delete our example, then put your own materials in.
